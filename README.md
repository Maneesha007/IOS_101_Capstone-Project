## Schema 

The schema for your app could include the following tables:

- **Users**: Stores information about each user, such as their username, password, profile picture, and saved locations.
- **Guides**: Stores information about each guide, such as their name, location, quote, and profile picture URL.
- **Locations**: Stores information about each location, such as its name, description, and associated guides.

### Models

Here are the models based on the schema:

- **User**
    - username: String
    - password: String
    - profilePicture: UIImage
    - savedLocations: [Location]

- **Guide**
    - name: String
    - location: String
    - quote: String
    - profilePictureURL: String

- **Location**
    - name: String
    - description: String
    - associatedGuides: [Guide]

### Networking

Here are the network requests by screen:

- **Login Screen**
    - (Read/GET) Query logged in user object

- **Registration Screen**
    - (Create/POST) Create a new user object

- **Profile Screen**
    - (Read/GET) Query logged in user object
    - (Update/PUT) Update user profile image

- **Home Screen**
    - (Read/GET) Query all guides where user is author

- **Guide Detail Screen**
    - (Read/GET) Query the guide object

Please note that these are just suggestions and you may need to modify them based on the actual requirements of your app and the backend service you are using. If you're using a specific backend like Firebase or Parse, you'll need to adjust the networking section to match the API calls for that service. If you're using an existing API, you'll need to list the endpoints you're using in the networking section. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
